### Hello! I'm Nanami!ðŸ‘‹



I'm a Software Engineer with a background in cloud computing, supercomputing, software and system architecture,
automation, and site reliability. Throughout my career, I've worked with a wide range of technologies, such as Java, Python, C, C++, Kubernetes, Docker, Airflow, Kafka, AWS, Git, Linux, SQL, and more. 

Outside of work, I'm a strong advocate for open-source development and actively contribute to projects that benefit the developer community. During my free time, I like to learn new things and work on personal projects. 
I'm really interested in computational science and research, chip and computer part manufacturing, and quantum technologies. 

I also like to add new books to my home library and have at-home spa days with my giant skincare collection!
