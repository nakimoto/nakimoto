### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I like learning new things and building cool things! Back-end engineer with interests in software infrastructure, architecture, automation, and supercomputing.

------------------

Beyond my career as a Software Engineer, I have a whole host of hobbies. I spend my time adding new books to my home library, tinkering with circuit boards, and designing fictional machinery.
