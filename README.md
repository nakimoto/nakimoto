### Hello! I'm Nanami!👋 This account is currently undergoing reconstruction! 

🚀 I'm a Software Engineer with a background in cloud computing, supercomputing, software and system architecture, automation, and site reliability. Throughout my career, I've worked with a wide range of technologies such as Java, Python, C, C++, Kubernetes, Docker, Airflow, Kafka, AWS, Git, Linux, SQL, and more. 

I have a B.S. in Computer Science and will begin working part-time on my M.S. in Computer Science towards the end of 2023. I'll be focusing on Quantum Algorithms and Super Computing, Electrical System and Chip Design, and Human-Computer Interaction. I'd like to pursue a Ph.D in Computer Science or a related field in the far future and participate in computational research.

I'm a strong advocate for open-source development and actively contribute to projects that benefit the developer community. During my free time, I like to learn new things and work on personal projects. I really like to read, especially books about math and science topics!
