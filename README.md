### Hello! I'm Nanami! Welcome to my personal GitHubðŸ‘‹

I like learning new things and building cool things!
I'm a back-end engineer with interests in cloud computing, software and system architecture,
automation, and supercomputing.

Outside of work, I'm a strong advocate for open-source development and actively contribute to projects that benefit the developer community. 
Collaboration and knowledge sharing are key values of mine. 

During my free time, I like to work on personal projects, experimenting with new tools and technologies.
I also like to add new books to my home library and have at-home spa days with my giant skincare collection!
