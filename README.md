### Hello! I'm Nanami! Welcome to my personal GitHubðŸ‘‹

I like learning new things and building cool things!
I'm a back-end engineer with interests in software infrastructure, architecture,
automation, and supercomputing.

Beyond my career as a Software Engineer,
I have a whole host of hobbies. I spend my time adding new books to my home library,
tinkering with any object I can find, and designing fictional machinery.
