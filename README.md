### Hello! I'm Nanami!👋 This account is currently undergoing reconstruction! 

🚀 Software Engineer with a background in cloud computing, supercomputing, software and system architecture, automation, and site reliability. Throughout my career, I've worked with a wide range of technologies such as Java, Python, C, C++, Kubernetes, Docker, Airflow, Kafka, AWS, Git, Linux, SQL, and more. 

I have a B.S. in Computer Science and will begin working on my M.S. in Computer Science towards the end of 2023. I'll be focusing on Quantum Algorithms and Super Computing, Electrical System and Chip Design, and Human-Computer Interaction. I'd like to pursue a Ph.D in Computer Science or a related field in the future and participate in computational research. 

Outside of work, I'm a strong advocate for open-source development and actively contribute to projects that benefit the developer community. During my free time, I like to learn new things and work on personal projects. I'm really interested in computational science and research, chip and computer part manufacturing, and quantum technologies.
